# 🤖 AI Tic-Tac-Toe (Minimax Algorithm)

A **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where you play against an **unbeatable AI** using the **Minimax algorithm**. This project demonstrates game logic, recursion, and decision tree algorithms in a clean and modular Python codebase.

🔗 [Live Repository](https://github.com/MEHATAJ-PS/AI-TicTacToe)

## 🧠 Features
- 🎮 Human vs AI gameplay
- ♾️ AI is unbeatable using the Minimax strategy
- 📦 Modular code (`main.py` and `utils.py`)
- 💡 Clean console interface with helpful prompts

```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Run the game using:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Choose your moves by entering a number from **1 to 9** (position layout shown below).

```
 1 | 2 | 3
---+---+---
 4 | 5 | 6
---+---+---
 7 | 8 | 9
```

## ⚙️ How the AI Works

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which recursively simulates all possible game states and always chooses the optimal move. It cannot lose.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x (no external libraries required)

## 📌 Resume Highlight

> Developed an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm in Python, demonstrating recursive decision trees and AI-based strategy implementation.
